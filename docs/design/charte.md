## Rules for the UI (humans and Claude Code)
1. Use only Tailwind theme tokens from `web/src/app/theme.css`. Never hard-code colours.
2. Body text is `text-ink` on white / `bg-surface-subtle`; secondary text `text-ink-muted`.
3. Never use `brand-green` (3.4:1), `brand-blue` or `brand-yellow` as text on white. Green text = `green-700`. Blue and yellow are fills with `text-brand-teal`.
4. Primary button: `bg-brand-teal text-white`. Highlight button: `bg-brand-yellow text-brand-teal`.
5. Domain colours: quality = teal, hygiene = blue, safety = yellow, environment = green (to confirm). Use for chips, tab underlines, chart series. A state always has a word or icon.
6. Font: Outfit for all UI text (`font-sans`, self-hosted with `next/font`). FinalSix only for display titles (`font-display`). Its licence is not confirmed yet: the file stays local in `web/public/fonts/final-six/` (git-ignored) and titles fall back to Outfit without it.
7. Controls >= 44px high, input border `border-border-strong`, visible focus ring, mobile first.
8. UI copy in French (sentence case, "vous"); code and keys in English (`quality`, `hygiene`, `safety`, `environment`).
9. Logos in `web/public/brand/` (primary logo by default on white; never recolour). Only the symbol (`reglo-symbol.png`) is available for now; the wordmark is written as text until the full logo is delivered. Favicon: `web/src/app/icon.png` and `apple-icon.png`.

## Contrast checked (WCAG)
teal/white 11.8; green-700/white 6.0; blue-700/white 6.6; ink-muted/white 6.2; teal on blue 7.2; teal on yellow 9.1; white on teal 11.8.

## UX principles (reference: Shopify admin)
1. **Fluid navigation**: client-side routing (Next.js `<Link>`), no full reloads. Use `loading.tsx` / Suspense skeletons, never a blank page.
2. **Top loading bar** on every page change (thin 3px bar, `brand-green`, fixed at top, e.g. `nextjs-toploader`).
3. **Sidebar** (collapsible on mobile): one entry per section, each with a 20px outline icon (Lucide) + label. Active entry: `bg-green-50`, `text-ink`, icon in `green-700`.
4. **Breadcrumb** on every page below the top level: `[icon] Section / [icon] Page / Detail`, each item a link with its page icon, last item not clickable, text `ink-muted`, separator `/`.
5. **Page header**: title (h1), short description, primary action on the right (one `btn-primary` only).
6. **Lists**: table with search, filters as chips, sortable columns, row click opens detail; empty state with an illustration-free message + one action.
7. **Feedback**: toast after save (bottom, 4s), skeletons while loading, inline errors on forms, confirmation dialog before destructive actions.
8. **Density**: calm, lots of white space, white cards on `surface-subtle`, max content width 1200px.
9. **Responsive**: mobile first; sidebar becomes a drawer, tables become cards under 768px.
10. **Accessibility**: keyboard navigation everywhere, visible focus, 44px targets, `aria-current="page"` on active nav and breadcrumb.
